What are your observations of the distance attenuation terms used for lighting on the sphere and  teapot/urn models?   \u27a2 Attenuation calculates the fraction of the original light intensity that is utili zed to colour  a  pixe l.   \u27a2 The longer  and further  light go from its source, the weaker it becomes.   \u27a2 The primary logic behind  attenuation  is to create a function that is inversely proportional to a  point's distance from the light source. The output would decrease as the distance between the  two points grew .  \u27a2 The attenuation is proportional to 1/d2. However, employing the 1/d2 function causes light to  progressively dim  very rapidly .   \u27a2 Instead of 1/d2, we use  1/(a + bd + cd2). We strive to set the values  of a, b, and c in a range such  that the attenuation term becomes  proportional to 1/d. It took a lot of trial and error to figure  out the right coefficient values  for a, b and c.     2. What are your observations about the change in the shading model on the two meshes?   \u27a2 The appr oach of two shading approaches highlights the differences between them.   \u27a2 The surface s of the objects appear to be smoother and shinier in the Phong model as compared  to the Goura ud model.   \u27a2 The specular highlight spot on the object s appeared to be  sharper in the case of the Phong   model as compared to the Goura ud model.  The spot was very much  distorted  (polygons)  in  the Gouraud  model .  \u27a2 During the use of mesh for the 3 -D model s \u2013   \u2022 In Gouraud shading , specular highlights present in the middle of a triangle  are not visible .  This is because  Gouraud shading interpolates the effects of light on the vertices.   \u2022 This problem is resolved  in the case of the  Phong shading  model  because the calculation of  effects of light is being calculated at each potential fragment of the surface.   \u27a2 Phong is computationally more expensive because the effect of light is computed at each point  instead of using linear interpolation of light effects  calculated at the vertices only.   \u27a2 Overall , Phong shading gives comparatively more  accurate results than Gouraud shading.     3. What are your observations of the individual components of reflection in the Blinn -Phong  model  for each of the mesh models you have used?   Phong lighting model diffuse reflection of rough surfaces and specular reflection of shiny  surfaces.   \u27a2 Ambient: The ambient lighting is always visible and is not affected by attenuation. If the  coefficient of ambient light is 1, the model appears flat . Ambient lighting is independent of the  model we are using.   \u27a2 Diffuse: A property of diffuse light is th at the  effect of light on a surface that can be seen better  if the light source is kept parallel  to the normal to the surface rather than at an angle to the  normal.  This difference cannot be easily observed in the case of a sphere because the normal a t  a point will be parallel to the light source even when the sphere is rotated. This is not true in the  case of the teapot. The effect of diffuse light can be seen on the bottom surface of the sphere on  rotating.   \u27a2 Specular: When the surface is less shi ny, the specular reflection results in a rough specular area.  Causes a bright spot of light to occur on both object s. The spot looks flat in Gouraud shading,  whereas, it looks smoother in Phong shading  in both the teapot and the sphere .                        Gouraud Shading Model \u2013 Polygon like (distorted) specular highlight spot                           Phong Shading Model \u2013 Smooth specular highlight spot   CODE SPECIFICS  & APPROACH:   1. Lighting  and Shading   \u27a2 Point lighted on a single object \u2013 Interpolat ion of the normals  for each of the points present on  the mesh enables the effect of a more natural object re flecting light from its surface.    \u27a2 We made a separate light class for hand ling the effects of lighting.   \u27a2 Each light object has its colo ur (ambient, diffuse, specular), position, and attenuation factor.   \u27a2 Each mesh object has its colo ur and coeffici ents of light colo urs k a, kd, ks.  \u27a2 The combination of the colour  of light and the colour  of the object will give the resultant  colour .  \u27a2 Directional lighting \u2013   \u2022 Here we learnt about the use of normal in determining the effect of lighting.   \u2022 Directional lighting acts on each face of the object.   \u2022 We calculate the dot product of the normal to a face with the direction of the light and add  this result to the colo ur of the object to observe the overall effect.   \u27a2 In the Blinn Phong model , we also have to pass the position of the eye/camera.  The shader  implemented for this model corresponds to the Phong shading method, in which we calculate  the normals and the colour  values in the fragment shader.   \u27a2 In the Gouraud  shading , we perform  all the colour  calculations in the vertex shader and then  send the final colour  after the completion  of all the calculations calculated colour  to the  fragment  shader.     2. Quaternions   \u27a2 The r otation has been implemented using quaternions   \u27a2 a system of rotation for the cameras using mouse drag in all directions, though that used basic  geometry to move a point along the sphere.   \u27a2 Two things were required \u2013 axis of rotation, angle to rotate the vector about that   \u27a2 Logic is similar to camera rotation . When our mouse  from A( X1, Y1) to B( X2, Y2) on the  screen  and we have a sphere of unit  radius present at the origin, we need to find the corresponding  points on the sphere  to A and B.   \u27a2 We assume the screen is a plane sheet present  at some positive Z value.  The points on this  plane  can be mapped onto the sphere by normalizing the coordinates  A and B with z - coordinate as Z.   \u27a2 Now, we have two points A' and B' on the sphere, between which we have to perform the  transformation. These two points are vectors with on e endpoint as the cent re of the sphere.   \u27a2 We can  find the axis of rotation to go from A' to B' by taking the cross product  of these 2  vectors . The angle of rotat ion can be found using the dot product of these two vectors.   \u27a2 For using the mouse as a trackball , we  keep track of the starting point of the mouse  down A  and the other point B.     3. Multiple Light Sources   \u27a2 We need to access the position of all the lights and the colour s as well.   \u27a2 The position values of the lights get autom atically updated while translating.   \u27a2 In the shader, we created a struct for holding all these values to make it more modular.   \u27a2 We created an array of structs of all the light sources and passed it to each of the mesh objects.   \u27a2 To get the resultant colour , we kept adding colour s from all the light sources.     4. Bounding Box Constraints   \u27a2 We use the inverse of the transformation matrix and multiply it with the position vector of the  light source to change it into model coordinates.   \u27a2 Then, we  compute the bounding box in model coordinates by finding the minimum and  maximum x,  y, and z values among all vertices in the mesh and multiplying it by 1.25. Direct  multiplication is fine because the object is originally centred at the origin in model coordinates.   \u27a2 Comparison of light coordinates with the bounding box coordinates checks whether the light   is inside the bounding box.
